# This example demonstrates a 3-pipeline configuration for the use case
# where a user wishes to perform further processing of aggregated span metrics
# prior to exporting; that is:
#   traces -> metrics-proxy-pipeline -> metrics
#
# The reason for requiring a proxy pipeline is because only exporters are
# capable of directly consuming data.
